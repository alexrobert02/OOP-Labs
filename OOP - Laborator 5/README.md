# LAB-5 (OPERATORS)

Write a class in C++ that has the following definition:
```
class Number
{
    // add data members
public:
    Number(const char * value, int base); // where base is between 2 and 16
    ~Number();
    
    // add operators and copy/move constructor
    
    void SwitchBase(int newBase);
    void Print();
    int GetDigitsCount(); // returns the number of digits for the current number
    int GetBase(); // returns the current base
}
```
Organize the code in the following way:
* a header file called **Number.h**
* a cpp file called **Number.cpp** that contains the source code for class **Number**
* a main file called **main.cpp** that contains the main function and has an example on how to use **Number**. The example must include using all methods from the class.
* add the following operators: addition, subtraction, index operator, relation operators (> , < , >= , <=, ==, etc)
* add copy & move constructors and move assignment operator
* when performing operations with two **Number** object that have a different base, the result (except for the relation and index operators) will have the biggest base of the two Number instances.
* for addition and subtraction use **friend** functions
* implement the -- operator with the following syntax: if used in a prefix form it will remove the first (most significant digit) from the number; if used in a post-fix form it will remove the last(least significant) digit from the number;

Example:
```
int main()
{
    Number n1("10110010",2);
    Number n2("734",8);
    Number n3("FF",16);

    printf("n1 has %d digits and it is written in base %d\n",n1.GetDigitsCount(),n1.GetBase());
    for (int tr=0;tr<n1.GetDigitsCount();tr++)
    {
        printf("n1[%d]=%c\n",tr,n1[tr]);
    }
    n1.Print();
    n2.Print();
    n1 = (n2+n3-n1)+n1; // after this n1 will be in base 16
    n1.SwitchBase(2);
    n1.Print();
    
    if (n1>n2) printf("n1 is bigger than n2\n"); else printf("n2 is bigger than n1\n");
    
    Number n4=12345; // n4 will be in base 10
    n1 = 255; // n1 will be 11111111 (value 255 from base 10 in base 2)
    n4 += n1;
    n4.Print();
    
    n4 = "13579"; // n4 mentains its base (10) and will be 13579
    n4.Print();
    --n4; // the first digit from n4 will be remove ==> n4 becomes 3579
    n4.Print();
    n4--; // the last digit from n4 will be remove ==> n4 becomes 357
    n4.Print();

    return 0;
}
```
